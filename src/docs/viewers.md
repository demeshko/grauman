Document and demonstrate the different viewers and how they work. This is the place to
show examples of what exactly STEREOSCOPIC_LAYOUT means, with, you know, screenshots
and things (or, can we put that right in the documentation of the STEREOSCOPIC_LAYOUT
enum itself?... if we can, that's probably a better place for it)

NOTE: This isn't the place to talk about how the actual components work internally
at a code level. This is the place for an overview of the various UI states, and
how they relate to the public interfaces of this library.
